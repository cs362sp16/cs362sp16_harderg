To produce random tests I chose to take the simple but effective approach of repeatedly feeding the cards randomly generated input. For both adventurer and sea hag I managed to cover 100% of the code for those cards. It takes a negligible amount fo time for the tests to run. However, for cutpurse I only managed to cover a little more than half. This is because I did not trigger on of the conditionals in that function. My total code coverage was lower than all of my unit and card tests from the last assignment. However, this is reasonable because I wrote more than twice as many tests for that assignment. In this case I think the unit tests detected more faults because it is easier to watch and see what is happening when things run one at a time.
