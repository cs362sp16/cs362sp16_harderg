While not immediately apparent, it seems to be the safe bet that the partner witht he working Dominion implementation is correct when there is a difference in the results of a random test. This is not an ideal case for differential testing because identifying where things went wrong in the test is difficult. In addition, because our dominion implementations are so complex there are a variety of factors that could be causing the difference making bugs hard to track down. Lastly, while the 'correct' implementation is probably correct, we cannot be sure it is a thoroughly correct implementation of the same program, like we would want for differential testing.

Code coverage was the same when there was no difference between them, but when they did differ the correct version had more lines covered.
